### Hello
My name is Muhammad Kamran master student at Hubei University, Wuhan. I am currently working on the preparation and phtoluminescence study data of phosphors by involving Machine Learning techiniques. Through Machine Learning we can detect their luminescence properties and predict the phosphor designs. Machine Learning and AI play vital role in big data collection.
